Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ewan.

Iâ€™m a software engineer with thirteen years of experience developing web applications and services, as well as providing technical leadership for small teams of software developers.

Iâ€™ve recently used Go. Iâ€™ve also written Elixir, Python, TypeScript, HTML. I learn quickly, care about detail, and love every new technology.

I currently live with my family in [Auckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make a LLM application.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything

You can [send me an email](mailto:yu@ohmyapps.com)
